"The time has come", said the Walrus, "to talk of many things." But first, we're
getting organised and figuring out how to use *yet another* toolchain.

Yes, friends, it's true; after years of using Github *and* Blogger.com *and*
Tumblr *and* Twitter *and* `$DEITY` only knows what all else (I've forgotten)
far too many other outlets for expression and attemped communication), one
reaches the point in life where having *one* drawer to put all your white socks
in becomes a Very Good Thing&trade;.

So here we are. :smile:
