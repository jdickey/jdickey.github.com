### Watch this!

**BE SURE** to open it in a new tab with Command-click or Ctrl-click! (and if anyone can tell me how to embed a YouTube video on github.io, I'd appreciate it...)

### How It Applies Here

There’s bad UX, there’s lazy UX, and then there’s _negligently, offensively stupid_ UX.

Or maybe the next _Grand Theft Auto: Vice City_ instalment should have all its signage in Québec French. We’d see each individual grain of dirt spinning off the wheels as Our Hero races down the highway; the debris from the guys shooting at him and hitting the road or the tree or whatever would be ballistically correct, but _the signs would make no sense_.

Oh well; its the same continent. Close enough. Right? _Wrong._
